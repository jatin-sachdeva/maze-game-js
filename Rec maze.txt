#creating a rectangular maze:

- Changes to be made:
    --Should have individual cells variable for horizontal and vertical ie grid array with diff rows and cols
    --Should have individual unitLength variable for a cell's height and width

- Process of making changes:
    --horizontal and vertical cells
        --- will create variables representing rows and cols of the grid array
        --- will update the cells with cellsRow and cellsCol
        --- new grid, horizontals and verticals array will be constructed
    --unitLength updation
        --- a new unitlengthX and unitlengthY will be made
        --- walls will now be formed corr to these new unitlengthX and unitlengthY
